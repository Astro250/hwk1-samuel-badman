# Here's the first line of code to play write to do the first homework assignment.
#
# In /scratch2/scratchdirs/nugent/astro250/hwk1 we have a set of fits files as well as catalogs
# from these fits files. They are named the same save for the suffix (.fits or .cat). 
# Some of the .cat files are missing. Write a bash shell script which takes as input 
# the directory name and prints out the names of the .fits files which are missing their 
# corresponding .cat files. If the directory does not exist, the code should print
# out an error statement accordingly.

dir=$1
